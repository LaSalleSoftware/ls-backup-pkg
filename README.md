Backup package for my LaSalle Software Version 2.

Spatie's [Laravel Backup](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-backup) is wonderful. However, I wouldn't mind having my own little backup package. Drawing heavy inspiration from this package, from [another Spatie package](https://github.com/spatie/db-dumper) that itself actually creates the "database dump file" for Laravel-Backup, and probably something subliminal from over a decade of using [Akeeba Backup](https://www.akeebabackup.com/), here I go with my own little LaSalle Software backup package.
